## Learnings

From this project, I learned a ton of things:

-localStorage: I figured out how to use `localStorage` to store data in the browser, which stays even after a page refresh. Super handy!

-ES6 Modules: I started organizing my code using ES6 modules, which helped keep things cleaner and more manageable.
-DOM Manipulation: I got more comfortable with DOM manipulationâ€”creating, modifying, and deleting elements based on what the user does.
-Helper Functions: I learned how to use helper functions to generate elements and keep my code neat and DRY.
-Flexbox and Grid**: I explored using both Flexbox and CSS Grid together for the layout, which made it way easier to create a responsive and well-aligned to-do list.
Overall, this project was a great learning experience!
